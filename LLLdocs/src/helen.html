<h1> To Hele</h1>
<h2> By Edgard Alan Po</h2>
<p/>
Helen, thy beauty is to me<br/>
Like those Nec√©an barks of yore,<br/>
That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,<br/>
The weary, way-worn wanderer bore<br/>
To his own native shore.<br/>
<p/>
On desperate seas long wont to roam,<br/>
Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,<br/>
Thy Naiad airs have brought me home<br/>
To the glory that was Greece,<br/>
And the grandeur that was Rome.<br/>
<p/>
Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche <br/>
How statue-like I see thee stand, <br/>
The agate lamp within thy hand! <br/>
Ah, Psyche, from the regions which <br/>
Are Holy-Land! <br/>
